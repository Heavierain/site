  heading: What to do?
  text: >-
    Well, as you know, we've got the tickets on here now. The form for you to
    mess around with, send me any messages throughout the day on there. We've
    got "watch me work" now, which I'll activate when I can. Keep checking "This
    Week" for plans, or submit your own in the "Talk to me" form, I'll add them.
    I'll try and add something to "Posts" every day for you. Head over to
    "Random Things", I've picked out some stuff I think you'll like, have a look
    there most days, I'll add something.


    I love you baby xxxx
