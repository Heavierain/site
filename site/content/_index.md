  text: Welcome to your website baby girl, I've spent a while building this up to
    what it is. I want this to be a place for you to come to, any time you're
    feeling low, or upset, or just need reminding about how much I love you,
    because I do, I always have, and I always will <3 <3 <3 <3

  heading: What to do?
  text: "Well I hope, as you're on here, you'll see things changing every now and
    then. I'm going to add things that I think you'll like. For now, I've made a
    little page where you'll be able to send me anything that's making you feel
    down, or upset, or even to ask for things, because I know how much you don't
    like asking me for anything. I hope this gives you a chance to, for one,
    feel as if I'm always here with you, two, you'll be able to see things
    update on here, like photos and videos of use both, and three, it'll be fun
    to see what I can come up with to make this YOUR website. "
